Movie Database Analysis Project (SQL)

🔹 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a movie database using advanced SQL concepts to extract meaningful insights related to users, movies, ratings, genres, and actors. The goal is to demonstrate strong skills in data analysis, querying, and window functions by solving real-world analytical problems.

🔹 Key Objectives

Analyze user behavior based on movie ratings

Identify top-rated movies and genre-wise performance

Perform actor and genre analysis

Apply advanced SQL techniques for ranking, comparisons, and trend analysis

🔹 Skills & Concepts Used

Joins (INNER, LEFT)

Aggregations (COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX)

Subqueries & CTEs

Window Functions

RANK(), DENSE_RANK()

ROW_NUMBER()

LAG()

Filtering & Grouping

Real-world analytical problem solving
